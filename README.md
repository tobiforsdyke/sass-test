# SASS Test
This is me trying out SASS (but mainly testing out GitHub!)
## Done
- Created local repo
- Installed Git on mac
- Tested out command lines
- Tried using Git from inside Atom
- Committed and Pushed files from command line and Atom

**Before starting tests open Terminal and navigate to the correct folder then type:**

```
sass --watch style.scss:output.css
```

(this automatically converts the scss file to the css file everyt time it is saved)
